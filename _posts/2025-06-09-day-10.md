what_i_learned: |  
   Today I learnt that we need 3 things in the Machine Learning Process. We talked about and went into **PENDAS**. It is a python library. we also discussed some functions like the head(), tail(), difference between drop(), and dropna(). Mergeing various files, getting the information about the file using info(), and more
   We also talked about Series and dataframe, how to pick a column to be our y and how to pick the columns that would be our X. We also saw a [**PENDAS** cheat sheet](https://studylib.net/doc/25268801/pandas-cheat-sheet).

  It was new territory so it was hard to keep up with at first, but I was able to quickly catch up.

reflection: |
   Today, I learned the three key components of the machine learning process and explored the Pandas Python library. We practiced using functions like head(), tail(), drop(), and info(), and learned how to merge datasets. I also understood the difference between Series and DataFrames, and how to choose X and Y variables. The Pandas cheat sheet was a helpful guide throughout the lesson.
