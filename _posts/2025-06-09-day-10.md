what_i_learned: |  
   Today I learnt that we need 3 things in the Machine Learning Process. We talked about and went into **PENDAS**. It is a python library. we also discussed some functions like the head(), tail(), difference between drop(), and dropna(). Mergeing various files, getting the information about the file using info(), and more
   We also talked about Series and dataframe, how to pick a column to be our y and how to pick the columns that would be our X. We also saw a [**PENDAS** cheat sheet] (https://studylib.net/doc/25268801/pandas-cheat-sheet).
