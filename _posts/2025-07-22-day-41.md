what_i_learned: |
  Worked on the Results section of our research paper.
    - while working on that I had to learn how to properly add tables and keywords to make the result section vibrant and organised

  After launch I made a model for the FNN model so that both teams of our project can have the same models for our final graphs
  the R2 score was 0.80 which is good.
  I worked on a task given to us by our graduate mentor.
  I got a code for GTW tree to work but it did not seem accurate as the r2 score was too low

  Spoke with Faculty mentor and checked and caught up on how to proceed
    - Was told to send her the doi of an article
    - Was told to try changing our dates to julian time and see how it affects what we have beeen doing so far.
    - was told to plot a 3d bar graph of the graph I have previously that compared the accuracy measure of the models we have.

  learning keyword to edit sections of the paper in overleaf.   
  
reflection: |
  Today I worked on the results section and learned how to organize it better using tables and keywords. After lunch, I built an FNN model for both teams, which gave a good R² score of 0.80. I completed a task from our graduate mentor and ran GTW Tree code, though its R² was low. I spoke with our faculty mentor about next steps and sent her a DOI of an article. She advised converting our dates to Julian time and plotting a 3D bar graph of model accuracy.
