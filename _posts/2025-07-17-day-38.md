what_i_learned: |
  Today started with a recap from Mrs Naja, we got an update on current progress and what would be expected of us next week.
  After which Mrs Anita Pandey gave us some advice for our research paper, and elevator pitch such as;
  - **Less is more** while making slides for a presentation
  - Avoid anything that can distract the audience
  - Share an outline
  - Use a max of 2 images per slide

  We also got some delivery tips such as 
  - Using team language
  - Avoid stimulants(caffeine)
  - Show excitement
  - Enjoy the spotlights
  - Got some recommended steps

  I was also able to write a summary for one of the research papers we read

  We got some recommendations to follow when writing the paper(results) such as
  - preparing the user for visuals
  - We should explain each visual
  - Discuss how each finding compares to the existing research.

  We ended the worshop with a Kahoot, which i ranked 2nd in

  During the second half of today 
  
  - I tried getting the code for the GTW tree that gave me a good score but I was unable to do so, the good thing is my gradient booosting has a high  r2 score of (0.84).
  - Ran a code that lasted as long as 1hr+
  - Met up with graduate mentor about trip we would have tommorrow and what to expect.
  - Sent over code to Mr Dan

    The GTW code
  
reflection: |
    Today was mostly spent training GTW and RF models with the new dataset. I saw improved R² scores, especially 0.83 with Gradient Boosting and 0.9 with GTW Tree. Debugging GTW code took up a lot of time. I also watched neural network videos and drafted part of our paper for tomorrow.
