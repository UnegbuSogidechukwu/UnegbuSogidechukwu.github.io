  Today started with a recap from Mrs Naja, we got an update on current progress and what would be expected of us next week.
  After which Mrs Anita Pandey gave us some advice for our research paper, and elevator pitch such as;
  - **Less is more** while making slides for a presentation
  - Avoid anything that can distract the audience
  - Share an outline
  - Use a max of 2 images per slide

  We also got some delivery tips such as 
  - Using team language
  - Avoid stimulants(caffeine)
  - Show excitement
  - Enjoy the spotlights
  - Got some recommended steps

  I was also able to write a summary for one of the research papers we read

  We got some recommendations to follow when writing the paper(results) such as
  - preparing the user for visuals
  - We should explain each visual
  - Discuss how each finding compares to the existing research.

  We ended the worshop with a Kahoot, which i ranked 2nd in

  During the second half of today 
  
  - I tried getting the code for the GTW tree that gave me a good score but I was unable to do so, the good thing is my gradient booosting has a high  r2 score of (0.84).
  - Ran a code that lasted as long as 1hr+
  - Met up with graduate mentor about trip we would have tommorrow and what to expect.
  - Sent over code to Mr Dan

    Today began with a recap from Mrs. Naja, followed by helpful presentation and writing tips from Mrs. Anita Pandey. I learned to keep slides simple, avoid distractions, and use team-oriented language when presenting. I summarized a research paper and got advice on how to explain visuals and compare findings. I placed 2nd in a Kahoot quiz that wrapped up the session. Later, I struggled with retrieving my GTW code, but my Gradient Boosting model achieved a strong R² score of 0.84.
