what_i_learned: |  
   I learned how Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems work, including how to properly clean and maintain them, which is required every six months. I got hands-on experience by opening the case, reading the manual, and successfully cleaning the device.  
  While writing the weekly presentation I reflected and realised that I had learned alot over this week. from learning about **Aerosols** and **PM 2.5**. Learned more about Climate and the atmosphere, had the opportunity to polish up my **Python skill**. 
  The highlight of this week is that I have an understanding of what I am doing and have an idea and image of what we would be doing in the upcoming week.

reflection: |
  Today, I learned how to clean and maintain a LIDAR system by reading the manual and working hands-on with the device. I also deepened my understanding of aerosols, PM 2.5, and climate systems. While preparing my weekly presentation, I reflected on how much I’ve learned, including improvements in my Python skills. The highlight was gaining a clear sense of direction for the work ahead.
