  Today my team and I filmed all the shots needed for our elevator pitch after brainstorming ideas. We recorded scenes in the business building, outside it, in front of Calloway Hall, and at the stadium construction site. I also stopped by the food pantry, wrote sections of the research paper, and started editing the elevator pitch video.
