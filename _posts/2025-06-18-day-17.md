what_i_learned: |  
  Today I met the highschool faculty I would be working with moving forward Mrs Rossjones, We had an icebreaker to make a superhero persona based on our strenghts and weakness, and it gave me insight into the members of my group. 
  
  I learnt that when stranded in the middle of the Ocean and no land in sight, according to a lifeguard a shaving mirror is more important than I thought.
  
  I learnt about VEX robotics and actually was able to use one in an obstacle course

   Noted that GX boost is a sequential tree while random forest is a parallel tree. I learned about GridsearchCV and its use in python. That overerfit in ML is when a model performs too well in it training data, and cant work as well with test data (cramming and not learning) whereas underfit does not work well with training and test data.

  

  
blockers: |
  Finding ways to describe our project to our highschool faculty following the guideline given. Fear of the weather hoping i get home on time

  
reflection: |
  Today, I met Mrs. Rossjones and learned more about my group through a superhero-themed icebreaker. I explored VEX robotics by guiding a robot through an obstacle course and learned a survival tip about using a mirror at sea. I also deepened my understanding of ML concepts like XGBoost vs. Random Forest, GridSearchCV, and overfitting vs. underfitting. Overall a fruitful day
