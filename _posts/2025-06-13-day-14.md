what_i_learned: |  
  During todays literature critique. I learnt about the following.
    - I learned about Insitu data and secondary data: In situ data is data gotten locally, on site, it basically means raw data. This data has a record of improving accuracy as it is highly accurate, whereas secondary data is data that has been processed, be it cleaned, or it has been through any form of data processing. This has a lower accuracy as an error made from processing, regardless of how little will greatly affect the training of the model.
    - We also got a revist from our graduate mentor about Conflict of interests (COI), and Ethics consideration. That we should look for these in articles we want to use in our research as it can affect us legally.
    - Through the articles reviewed I also learned that multilayered models are usually more accurate.
    - I also learned that Spatio-temporal data refers to information that varies across both space (geographic location) and time.

reflection: |
  Today was fruitful. I feel like I am actually taking steps towards my goal during the program and achieveing my groups goal. The mentioning of COIs, and Ethics in research also served to remind me that there is more to this than just making a new discover, as polictics, interests, and Ethics play major roles in research. Overalll it was a good day.
