    Today I:
    - I built a neural network 
    -  trained the network and made some observations such as the r2 score incresing with the length of training time.
    - I wrote the about me of the final paper.
    - Had discussion with graduate mentor on next steps, and research paper some tips, pros and cons.
    - Had a team building activity (played Uno).
    - Completed tasks given by faculty mentor
    - had a zoom call with project mebers for a quick recap, catching up and planning next steps

reflection: |
    Today I built and trained a neural network, observing that the R² score improved with longer training. I wrote the "About Me" section for our final paper and had a helpful discussion with my graduate mentor about next steps. We also had a fun team-building session playing Uno. Lastly, I completed all tasks assigned by my faculty mentor.
