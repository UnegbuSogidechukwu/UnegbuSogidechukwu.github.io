reflection: |
  Today was productive—I got to visualize data using graphs and made progress in the Kaggle course, especially around interpolation. I also worked on our team’s deliverable, updated my slide, and reflected on my growth so far. After hearing back from our mentor, I’m excited about what’s ahead, especially flying the drone next week.
