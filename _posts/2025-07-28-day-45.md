what_i_learned: |
  Today I added the graphs I worked on and others sent to me to the Overleaf document
  I worked on a demo video Template and received the follwoing advice
    - Scroll through the code slower, and try to keep it under 2 minutes
  Learned how to work on Canva
    - made a 90 seconds template for the Demo
    - laid out the foundation for the new Demo (I am still wondering how to scroll slowly as I do not have an external mouse)
  Ran an LSTM code and got the feature importance for the model
  Created a Actual Vs Predicted graph for FNN
  - Learnt that neural networks use permutation importance as opposed to feature importance. I did not look deep into it but it says that permutation importance is more reliable for Neaural Networks.

  Making the demo, learning Canva 
  
reflection: |
  Today I added all graphs—including mine and those from teammates—to the Overleaf document. I worked on a demo video template, got feedback to scroll slower and stay under 2 minutes, and began building the layout in Canva. I ran LSTM code for feature importance and created an Actual vs Predicted graph for FNN. I also learned that permutation importance is considered more reliable for neural networks than standard feature importance.
