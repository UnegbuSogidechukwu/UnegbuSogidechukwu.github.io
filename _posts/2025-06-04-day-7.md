what_i_learned: |
  Today I leanred and used the site [NASA GIOVANNI](https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/#service=TmAvMp&starttime=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&endtime=2025-04-30T23:59:59Z) To plot a graph and had a preview of the datat I would be working on over the duration of CEAMLS and its data type.
  
  **Comma Seperated Values (CSV)** is the data type I would be dealing with so i learned how to read files from CSVs using python
  
  Learned about lists from [learn lists in python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) while learning I learnt that python allows negative indexing I also learned about various keywords like pop, clear etc.
  learned about [**Ocean Eddies**](https://thegeographyteacher.com/black-holes-in-oceans/)

  Today, I used the NASA GIOVANNI platform to plot a graph and preview the dataset I'll be working with in CEAMLS. I learned that the data comes in CSV format and practiced reading CSV files using Python. I also explored Python lists, including features like negative indexing and list methods such as pop() and clear(). Additionally, I learned about ocean eddies and their role in ocean dynamics.
