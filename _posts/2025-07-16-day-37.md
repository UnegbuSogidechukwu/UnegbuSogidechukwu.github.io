what_i_learned: | 
    Today was monotonic. As i mostly
    - Trained neural networks in GTW and RF with the new data set that we got
    - noticed an increase in R2 score especially for Gradient boosting (0.83)
    - I got a good R2 score with GTW tree (0.9) but the code had errors making me spend the rest of the day on that
    - watched some youtube videos on neural networks
    - wrote a quick part for our paper for tommorrows workshop
    
    
blockers: |
    The codes was a handful
  
reflection: |
    Today was mostly spent training GTW and RF models with the new dataset. I saw improved R² scores, especially 0.83 with Gradient Boosting and 0.9 with GTW Tree. Debugging GTW code took up a lot of time. I also watched neural network videos and drafted part of our paper for tomorrow.
