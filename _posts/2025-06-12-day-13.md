what_i_learned: |  
  Today I learnt and improved my communication, and quick thinking skills during the SAIRI cohort connect through the ice breaker games Taboo, and jenga. I learned about and was introduced to Overleaf where I learned certain keywords such as \subsections{}, \subsubsection{}. I also learned how to add images to our projects on Overleaf

  Learned difference betweeen Machine Learning Algorithm and Machine Learning Model. A Machine Learning model is the output (trained system) of training an algorithm with data. and Machine Learning algorithm is a procedure or set of rules used to train a model. Models are trained algorithms.

reflection: |
  Today’s SAIRI session helped me improve communication and quick thinking through games like Taboo and Jenga. I also learned Overleaf, mastering commands like \subsection{} and image insertion. Most importantly, I clarified the difference between an ML algorithm (training process) and an ML model (trained output). These skills will boost my teamwork and technical projects. Excited to apply them in the future.
