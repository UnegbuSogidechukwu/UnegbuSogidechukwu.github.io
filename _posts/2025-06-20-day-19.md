what_i_learned: |  
  Today I learnt:
    - Support Vector Machine(SVM) model was developed in the 1990s by Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues at AT&T Bell Labs.
    - SVM is inspired by the concept of finding a model that generalizes well, not just fits training data.
    - SVM can be used for both regression and classification.
    - That SVM finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates data into classes with the maximum margin (margin being the distance to nearest data points, called support vectors). It uses kernels to handle non-linear data.
    - Examples of kernels in SVM are Polynomial Kernel, RBF Kernel, Sigmoid Kernel. SOme uses of SVM is text prediction, and image classification
