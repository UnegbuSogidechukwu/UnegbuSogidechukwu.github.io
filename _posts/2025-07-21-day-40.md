reflection: |
  Today I learned more about using Overleaf, including how to reference papers using BibTeX and format citations and bibliographies. I also learned how to properly list authors and affiliations. We got updates on the program moving forward, which gave more clarity. Back in the lab, I adjusted model parameters and began seeing noticeable changes. I also started working on graphs for the results and analysis section of our paper.
