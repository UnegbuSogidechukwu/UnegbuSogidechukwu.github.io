reflection: |
  Today expanded my skills in research writing through Morgan State's Writing Centers presentation. I started a Kaggle's ML course. I started exploring LSTM networks for PM2.5 analysis. Joined the AI Zoom session although late I still learned what I could. It was a balanced day bridging academic writing, machine learning foundations, and applied research.
