what_i_learned: |  
  Today I learnt more about Geographically and Temporally Weighted **GTW** Tree algorithms. These algorthms are extensions of Geographically Weighted Regression **GWR** that incorporate both spatial and temporal dimensions in the weighting scheme. 
  Using a GTW tree algorithm to train our model we were able to achieve an R2 score that was reater than 0.9
  Learnt more about the presentation on friday and what to do on my part.
  Was able to overcome an issue I had with my random forest algorithm. Being that I used the wrong values for X and Y which lead to the low performance I was experiencing before. I was greatful for the debugging practice of reading code line by line as this simple mistacke would have been further unnoticed if I did not read each line of code.

  The long runtime was expereinced in full today as it was a model training day.
  
reflection: |
  Overall the day was fruitful. I am partly happy with the R2 score being high, but I know I would have to look deeper into the algorithm as it was an algorithm that I saw in a paper and used, while i understand the reason for the high score I still no little about it in my opinion. but generally the day was a good day due to the score and seeing my check on GAD.
