what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt the following. The factors that affect pollution in the environment can be divided between human and natural factors. Some sources of pollution are construction, light pollution, gas, cars, and more. 
  A fact i learnt is that air pollution is the **4th** cause of death globally
  I learnt what data cleaning (clearing wrong data), and data normalization (consistency)
  PM 2.5 consists of dusts, soot. These are usually invisible and dangerous. negative implication of PM2.5 is that it affects our lungs, can cause heart attack, and more. Some effect of PM 2.5 is that it creates haze, effects water bodies and sail. italso affects solar panel efficiency.

  **AOD** Aerosol Optical Depth
  Our goal for this project is **Using the relationship between satellite data(AOD) and land data (PM 2.5) make an ML model that can find PM 2.5 with just stallite data** PM is reliant on other factors such as humidity, temperature and more. Learned about a good learning site called [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

reflection: |
  Today’s session helped me understand the major causes of pollution, which can be both human-made and natural. I was shocked to learn that air pollution is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. I also learned about data cleaning and normalization, which are important for preparing datasets. PM2.5 is especially dangerous and can harm both health and the environment. I'm excited to work on a project using satellite data (AOD) to estimate PM 2.5 with machine learning.
