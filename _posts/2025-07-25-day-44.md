    - Learnt about the different waves classes such as Delta, Beta, Gamma.
    - Flew a drone(again) this time using my brain waves ECG
    - Controlled a robot using my muscle movements (EMG)

reflection: |
  Today began with a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) workshop led by Dr. Chris S. Crawford. I learned about the origins of using brainwave-based ECG signals, with early work starting in the 1960s, and explored wave types like Delta, Beta, and Gamma. I flew a drone using my brainwaves and controlled a robot with muscle signals (EMG). After the workshop, I met with our graduate mentor to discuss final deliverables, took a group photo, and started working on our final presentation slides.
