  Nothing serious or worth talking about 
  
reflection: |
  Today I searched YouTube for background music and finalized the elevator pitch video. I added all my graphs to the paper and learned how to edit the images properly. I also learned the Hama Wena and Jerusalema dances, and found out that IEEE in-text citations don’t require names. After getting feedback from my mentors and teacher, I was told to review one of the feature importance graphs that seemed off.
