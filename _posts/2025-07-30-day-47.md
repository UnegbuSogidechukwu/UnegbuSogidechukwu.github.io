  Today I updated the graphs in both Overleaf and the final presentation. As a team, we merged our station graphs into one for easier formatting. We practiced our final presentation and received helpful feedback from our graduate mentor and high school teacher. I implemented the suggested updates and learned how to merge images in Overleaf. Lastly, I prepared a note with my talking points in order.
