what_i_learned: |  
  Learnt that I had clip champ which was what I used to edit the recording of the demo that I made.
  Learnt how to host a Zoom session, screen share with audio and screen recording
  Learnt that I had a good habit of looking at the crowd during review with mentors and Highschool teacher.
  Learnt that I had the motion problem of being unable to stay still.
  Learnt to make the demo short as the original demo length was 6+ minutes and when I did make it shorter (approximately 4 mins. I should be prepared to cut it short during the presentation if the need calls for it.
  
blockers: |
  Recorsing and editing the demo.
  
reflection: |
  Today, I learned to use Clipchamp to edit my demo and gained Zoom hosting skills like screen sharing with audio. I received feedback highlighting my good habit of making eye contact, but also noted my tendency to move too much. I also learned the importance of keeping the demo concise and being prepared to shorten it further during the presentation if needed.
