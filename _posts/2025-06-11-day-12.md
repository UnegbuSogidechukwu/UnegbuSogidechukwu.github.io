what_i_learned: |  
  Today, I learned about positive and negative correlations and how they relate to data analysis. I critiqued several articles and learned how to properly cite them, including author names, publication year, and volume. The articles focused on the use of AI and machine learning in monitoring Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and PM 2.5.

We also explored the concept of outliers, encoding methods, and data visualization—turning data into charts and plots using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Altair. I gained a better understanding of when to use merge versus concatenate, and the differences between "inner" and "outer" joins.

We discussed the importance of using .values to convert data into NumPy arrays when working across multiple libraries. Additionally, we covered correlation matrices, heatmaps, box plots, and other visualization tools. Finally, we touched on splitting datasets into training and testing sets, parameter tuning, and were introduced to AI models and how to import them into our code.

   Today I deepened my understanding of data analysis concepts like correlation, outliers, and data visualization. I learned how to properly cite academic articles and explored how AI/ML are used to monitor AOD and PM 2.5. We worked with Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data. I also practiced merging and concatenating datasets, and saw how .values helps with NumPy compatibility. Finally, I was introduced to splitting data for training/testing and basic AI model integration.
