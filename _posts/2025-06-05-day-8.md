what_i_learned: |  
  During the CEAMLS enrichment block, I toured the Morgan State University campus [Morgan Map](https://map.morgan.edu/?_gl=1*1rtrfy9*_ga*NzczNzkxMTI3LjE3MzY0MDM5Nzc.*_ga_T3TCY7Q7D7*czE3NDkxNDE5MTIkbzIxJGcxJHQxNzQ5MTQzMzA4JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..). I also learned about the steps involved in launching the balloon we use for data collection. I participated in filling the balloon with hydrogen gas, observed the system setup, and noted key features—such as the need to connect the balloon to a laptop and antenna, ensuring all indicators turn green before launch. We successfully launched the balloon and began collecting data.

  During CEAMLS enrichment, I toured Morgan State University and learned more about the campus layout. I helped fill a data-collecting balloon with hydrogen and observed the full launch system setup. We had to ensure all indicators turned green before proceeding. The balloon was successfully launched, marking an exciting start to our data collection.
