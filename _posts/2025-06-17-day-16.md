what_i_learned: |  
  Today I learnt 
    - how to train a dataset for machine learning for a large dataset 
    - plotted the graph using various graphing methods to visually analysize a graph.
    - I checked the accuracy of the model, and currently know hoe to check the accuracy of models.
    - I learnt about each line of codes as we went through the code line by line to understand the syntax.
    - hyperparameters affect the model before training E.G n-estimators, random_state

  none

reflection: |
  Today I learned to train ML models on large datasets by tuning hyperparameters like n_estimators and analyzing their impact on performance. I visualized data patterns using various plots and evaluated model accuracy through key metrics, deepening my practical ML skills. Finally, I strengthened my coding understanding by examining each line's purpose in the implementation process.
