what_i_learned: |
  Today began with an introduction in the auditorium. We received a presentation from Mrs. Walters about the basics of research in AI and how to approach and tackle research problems. She explained that AI research is nondeterministic—meaning it can yield different responses under the same conditions—unlike traditional research, which is more deterministic (consistant with result).

  My group and I completed a successful 20+ inch marshmallow challenge. The experience taught us valuable lessons about problem-solving and teamwork, which we can apply to similar challenges in the future, and personally taught me how to approach the mershmello challenge in future icebreakers

  During our lab session, we reviewed the fundamentals and discussed what we’ll be working on throughout the summer. I learned about **aerosols**, which are suspension systems of solid or liquid particles in a gas. Our faculty mentor assigned us the task of reading and writing a critique on two research papers focused on urban pollution.

reflection: |
  Today’s sessions provided a strong start to the program. I learned how AI research is different from traditional research due to its unpredictable nature. The marshmallow challenge highlighted the importance of teamwork, quick thinking, and problem-solving. In the lab, we discussed our summer projects and explored the concept of aerosols.
