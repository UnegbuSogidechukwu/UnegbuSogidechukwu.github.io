what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt:
  - Drones: from how to fly one, the controls, and receiving a first class view and experience of one being flown
  - About the site and the instruments there from things like the maintanance, purposes and more
  - Took picture around the sites

  Today we brainstormed ideas for our elevator pitch we had a pitch that we liked, such as the Hackers Vs defenders, and the rap song pitch
  - Some tips we took were:
    - Picking one orientation for the video
    - Putting effort in picking our background
    - coming with energy to keep user attention and more.

  My stuff got stuck in the vending machine +1 to the number of times this has happened to me.    
  
reflection: |
  Today I learned how drones work—how to fly them, control them, and got a front-row view of one in action. We explored the site, learned about its instruments and maintenance, and took pictures around the area. During our brainstorming session, we came up with fun elevator pitch ideas like “Hackers vs. Defenders” and a rap-themed pitch. We also got helpful tips on video orientation, backgrounds, and using energy to engage viewers. A small hiccup: my stuff got stuck in the vending machine… again.
