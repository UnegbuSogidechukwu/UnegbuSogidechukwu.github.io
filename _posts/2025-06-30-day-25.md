what_i_learned: |  
  I continued working on the Demo and put together the codes that will be in the demo
  Had a fruit dul conversation with a team member about the future of AI and the potential for AI and I was told about an interesting story[There will come soft rains by Ray Bradbury](https://www.btboces.org/Downloads/7_There%20Will%20Come%20Soft%20Rains%20by%20Ray%20Bradbury.pdf)
  Had some team bonding activity with team members (E.g Simon says)
  Scraped previous data as it was said to be wrong, and started using the new data given by faculty mentor which brought our R2 score to a low 0.6 to 0.5
  Looked over graph from new data and while it does have a lower R2 score it follows the laws that we learned such as the fact that summer has the highest time for AOD and PM 2.5 detection. I decided to add the graph to the demo
  
  
blockers: |
  The R2_score was unable to reach 0.62 and above.
  
reflection: |
  Today I continued working on the Demo, the Team bonding activities offset the challenge of switching datasets, which lowered our R² score but confirmed expected seasonal trends. The good news is that the model now follows the common consensus soo tommorrow I would see if I can finalize the demo and improve the R2 score. I suspect it to be low due to low amount of data(6800+) but I would see tommorrow. The day was nice
