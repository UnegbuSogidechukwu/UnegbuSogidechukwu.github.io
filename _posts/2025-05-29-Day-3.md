what_i_learned: |
  During the Introduction to Computer Vision presentation done by Andrew Kelly, I learned a lot, such as what computer vision is, how object detection works, as well as object tracking and image segmentation. I learned how to use [Teachable Machine with Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train), where I trained a model. We also went a step further using Google Colab and made a detection code using YOLO by Ultralytics. I was also introduced to the concept of Region of Interest. We continued with the Python 101 course, where I was reintroduced to typecasting and input/output in Python.

reflection: |
  Overall today was a productive day. I attended an Introduction to Computer Vision session by Andrew Kelly, where I learned about object detection, tracking, image segmentation, and Regions of Interest. I trained a model using Teachable Machine and later used Google Colab to run detection code with YOLO by Ultralytics. We also continued with Python 101, refreshing my knowledge on typecasting and input/output. It was a great mix of theory and hands-on learning.
