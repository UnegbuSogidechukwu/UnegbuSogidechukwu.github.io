what_i_learned: |  
  Today I :
    - I revisited Classification and regression models 
    - Learned about feature importance in ML and what it means, and how to write the code for it.
    - Talked about ML evaluation metrics for classification such as accuracy, precision recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
    - The ML evaluation metrics for regression Mean absolute error, mean squared error, R2 score, and root mean squared error.
    - Learnt how we get the PM2.5 here on ground 
      - This is done through a filtration setup so that each filter catches a certain PM size. 
    - A factor that served an issue in our AOD data is that we only have data for day time. As AOD is gotten through reflection of light and other factors play a role. However at night the lack of sunlight makes data collection impossible using our current technology.

  The temperature was not the best

  While training my random forest model I got a R2 score of 0.76 and could not go above it regardless of what I did. 
  
reflection: |
  I reviewed ML models, focusing on feature importance and evaluation metrics. Learned AOD's limitation—daytime-only data—highlighting challenges for 24/7 PM2.5 prediction. Overall the day was hot, but I learned alot today from evaluation metrics, to how PM 2.5 is gathered on ground sites. I looked at the slide for friday and so far I am really enjoying the program.
