what_i_learned: |
  In **Python 101**, I learned more about conditionals, comparisons, and logical operators. I was also introduced to a free resource called [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/), which helps visualize code execution. Additionally, I gained valuable insights into **Generative AI** during a presentation by *Clyde Tandjong*. I learned about emerging generative AI tools such as **DALL·E**, **Suno.ai**, and **Eleven Labs**. One key takeaway was that the "Large" in *Large Language Models* refers to the massive datasets used to train them. I was introduced to new terms like **tokenization** and **embeddings**, and explored various **prompt engineering techniques**. The presentation also covered **AI watermarks** and **signatures**, which are raising ethical concerns in the industry.
