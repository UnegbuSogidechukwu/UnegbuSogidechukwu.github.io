what_i_learned: |
  I successfully streamed live EEG data from the OpenBCI headset into my Python dashboard using Lab Streaming Layer (LSL). I implemented a basic smoothing algorithm and added visualizations for alpha and beta band activity, updating in real time.

  This helped me better understand how attention levels fluctuate, especially when switching between tasks. I also learned how to calculate moving averages to reduce noise in the signal while preserving response time.

blockers: |
  None

reflection: |
  Watching my brainwaves animate in real time felt surreal. It made all the previous setup work worth it. Next, I’ll begin connecting this live data stream to robotic behaviors in NeuroLink Assist—starting with simple directional movement based on concentration strength.
