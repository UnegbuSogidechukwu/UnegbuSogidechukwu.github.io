what_i_learned: | 
    Today we observed our plotted graphs and made the following deductions
    - We noticed that summer is high for all data
    - 2021, has a maximum pollution event in July wildfires in western US and canada
    - December 2019 we had high PM2.5 but not AOD inverted temperatures trapping the aerosol near the ground
    - we noticed that 2022 has the weakest cycle. it does not have heavy pollution

    We received tasks from our mentor such as:
    - We shuld use different AI model
    - The models we would be using are Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression, Geographically Temporally Weighted (GTW) tree
      Long Short Term Memory
    - We were also told to interpulate data 

    We had a meeting this morning about our Myers Briggs personality and our learning styles

    Today we analyzed our plotted graphs and noticed key patterns, such as high summer pollution levels and a major event in July 2021 due to wildfires. Our mentor gave us tasks including trying new AI models like Random Forest, SVR, and LSTM, and interpolating data. We also discussed our Myers-Briggs personality types and learning styles during a morning meeting. It was a productive day combining data insights and personal development.
