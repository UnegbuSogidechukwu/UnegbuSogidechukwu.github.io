what_i_learned: |  
  I learnt about how tsunamis and earthquakes are caused by the same phenomena. The constant motion of molten in the earth crust finds **fault lines** that allows them to rush to the surface. A tsunami is simply the same as an earthquake but happens under a body of water.
  The reason PM becomes deadly is because of coagulation. Coagulation makes the otherwise tiny and unnoticeable particles get big enough to have adverse effects on us who breathe it in.
  The major determinant of the dispersion of pollutants is weight and temperature.
  Learn more about aerosols during our literature review and critique particularly carbonaceous aerosols that help in light absorption. I also learnt that the cloud is not just an aerosol sink (The end spot for aerosols) but also a source
  We also talked about the lifecycle of aerosols.

reflection: |
   Today, I learned that tsunamis and earthquakes are caused by the same geological activity, with tsunamis occurring underwater. I also explored how particulate matter becomes harmful through coagulation, making tiny particles more dangerous to inhale. The dispersion of pollutants depends largely on weight and temperature. Additionally, I learned that clouds can act as both sources and sinks for aerosols, and gained insight into the lifecycle of aerosols, especially carbonaceous ones. Today was a fruitful day
