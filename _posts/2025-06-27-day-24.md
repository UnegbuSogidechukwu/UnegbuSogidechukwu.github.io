what_i_learned: |  
  Learnt more about the syntax for a Geographical Temporal Weighted Tree (GTW).
    - GTWNode: This represents a node in the tree with geographic (lat, lon), temporal (time), and weighted features.
    - GTWTree: This manages the tree structure and supports spatio-temporal range queries.
  Began working on the Demo for our presentation on Thursday 
  
blockers: |
  Seeing latitude and longitude in something other than the world map has me shook. I would look into it and why it is called what it is called
  
reflection: |
  Overall I feel brain fried and tired. I feel like I went further than the general idea of how Neural networks work and went into its mechanics. It is useful information(hopefully). It was worth learning though. Catching up on missed work was quick and I and my team members continue to prepare for the presentation that is on Thursday 3rd
