what_i_learned: |  
  Learnt more about the syntax for a Geographical Temporal Weighted Tree (GTW).
    - GTWNode: This represents a node in the tree with geographic (lat, lon), temporal (time), and weighted features.
    - GTWTree: This manages the tree structure and supports spatio-temporal range queries.
  Began working on the Demo for our presentation on Thursday 
  Went over the Mid_summer presentation and week 5 deliverable with Graduate mentor
  I learnt that a demo in this case is ONLY codes, making me scrap my previous script as I had space for the progress we made and then talk about the codes.
  
blockers: |
  Seeing latitude and longitude in something other than the world map has me shook. I would look into it and why it is called what it is called
  
reflection: |
  Today I learned about the GTW Tree syntax, where GTWNode stores spatio-temporal data (lat, lon, time, weight) and GTWTree enables efficient range queries. Prepared a code-only demo for Thursday’s presentation after feedback, scrapping my earlier script that mixed progress updates with code. Reviewed the mid-summer goals with my mentor. Overall the day was fruitful and I look forward to next week
