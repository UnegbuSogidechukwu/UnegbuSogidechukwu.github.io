what_i_learned: |  
  Today I learnt the following:
    - Today I learnt about random forest algorithm, it is the algorithm with the highest success rate among all the algorithms we reviewed. During our literature review we talked about Random forest, its origin and advantages
    - We learnt about the basics of MAchine Learning (ML). What ML is . we also spoke about supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. 
      - Supervised learning: We give the model a characteristic and label. OUr project will be built on supervised learning
      - Unsupervised learning: It has the data but not a label, example of this is youtube recommendation etc.
      - Reinforcement: in this we give it an input, it gives us an output and we give it feedback on its output. AN example of this is a model  made to identify a dog for instance.
