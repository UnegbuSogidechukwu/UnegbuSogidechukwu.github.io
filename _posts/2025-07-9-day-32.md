what_i_learned: |  
  Today I completed the Kaggles **intro to deep learning** course. While finishing the corse I learnt:
    - About Special layers such as dropout layer and batch normalization.
    - That batch normalization helps correct training that is slow or unstable
    - The formula for accuracy in neural networks
    - About cross entropy functions: these are the loss functions for classification models

  Today I also learnt about interpolation
    - Interpolation helps us find value between 2 known table values
    - about terminologies in interpolation such as: Width, fraction, distance from the top, etc.

  I also learnt how to plot certain time periods not just the whole graph.
  Check other AI models with our current datasets.
  I went to the Morgan pantry today and got some produce.
