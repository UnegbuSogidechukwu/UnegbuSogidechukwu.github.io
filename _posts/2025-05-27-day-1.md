what_i_learned: |
  I learned about Git and GitHub, including new command-line tools such as git push, git pull, git log, and more. I also gained an understanding of version control systems and got to know the members of my project team, who I’ll be working with throughout the duration of CEAMLS. Additionally, I successfully created and published my first website on GitHub.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  As the first day and orientation of CEAMLS, it was exciting to dive into the program, meet other members, and start learning about GitHub. I initially thought GitHub would be difficult or complicated, but I found that it follows a fairly straightforward structure, similar to other software tools. Overall, my first day went really well.
