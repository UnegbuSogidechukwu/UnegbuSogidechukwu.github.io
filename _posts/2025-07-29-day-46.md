what_i_learned: |
  Today I made the voiceover for the demo I learnt alot about canva such as how to
  - Creating subtitles
  - Doing voiceovers
  - learnt about editing in canva

  I also find it interesting how a video on creating subtitles from 2021 spoke about making the subtitles manually whereas for me to make the subtitles today all I needed was a click of a button and time (approx 1 hour)

  I finished working on my section for the overleaf paper.
  Went through final presentation with Graduate mentor

  Extra: got free lunch from the room 116 😁😁

  Felt tired the whole day 
  
reflection: |
  Today I created the voiceover for our demo and explored several features in Canva, including subtitle creation, voiceover recording, and video editing. I also completed my section of the Overleaf paper and reviewed our final presentation with my graduate mentor. As a bonus, I scored a free lunch from Room 116 😁.
