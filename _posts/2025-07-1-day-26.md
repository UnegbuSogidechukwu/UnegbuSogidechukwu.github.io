what_i_learned: |  
  Today I Made significant progress on the demo and would record the voiceover that will be played during the presentation tommorrow.
  Today We played Uno and had some team bonding activities, I learned that the blank wildcards in uno meant that you can make up the rule for the card
  I learned from Mrs Ross Jones that the reason there are many graveyards in Baltimore is because of the Civil war.
  I learnt how to plot better graphs in python even writing a code that plots two scatterplots in on figure graph. making comparison of two graphs that are side by side easier.

reflection: |
  Today, I made major progress on the demo and prepared a voiceover for tomorrow’s presentation. I enjoyed team bonding through Uno and learned that the blank wildcards allow players to create their own rules. I also improved my Python graphing skills by plotting two scatterplots in one graph and learned a bit of local history about Baltimore’s many Civil War-era graveyards. The day was fruitful.
