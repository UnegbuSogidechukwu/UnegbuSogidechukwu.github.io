what_i_learned: |  
  Today I learnt about neural network. To me neural network, deals with weights and biases, and that each run of the model with a dataset the model changes its parameters (Bias, weight, etc) To improve itself. This is the reason it relies on a large dataset to be trained. The two main Neural network libraries are Tensorflow and Pytorch. Neural networks consists of input, hidden and output layers. FInally at the end of it all this is MAthematicas as The final output is a summation of the input, its werighted value, and Bias. This may not be the norm but the video series I went through emphasied this.
  I also worked on my presentation slides and caught up from what happened when I was absent on Day 22
  
blockers: |
  neural network feels hard, and complicated. I have yet to start writing codes and am already feeling the difficulty, and long runtime it has.
  
reflection: |
  Overall I feel brain fried and tired. I feel like I went further than the general idea of how Neural networks work and went into its mechanics. It is useful information(hopefully). It was worth learning though. Catching up on missed work was quick and I and my team members continue to prepare for the presentation that is on Thursday 3rd
