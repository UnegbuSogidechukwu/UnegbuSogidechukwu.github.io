subtitle: Air Pollution & Machine Learning
project_title: "Monitoring Urban Air Pollution from Satellite Data using Machine Learning."

problem: |
  Many communities in the Baltimore area are disproportionately affected by poor air quality, leading to higher rates of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. Despite growing awareness, there is a lack of localized, real-time monitoring and community-driven solutions to address air pollution.

  This project aims to investigate the sources and patterns of air pollution in Baltimore and explore how data-driven interventions can support healthier environments and more informed policy decisions.

approach: |
  The project follows the following steps

  - Literature review and Collection of data into one central google drive and basic quality control by plotting and visual inspections.
  - Format data and use them for supervised machine learning such as random forest
  - Apply a deep learning algorithm to the same data sequences
  - Algorithm validation and comparison with unsupervised learning results.
    

outcome: |
  The outcomes of this program will equip participants with machine learning techniques for satellite data retrieval related to air quality in the Baltimoreâ€“Washington area. Participants will gain practical knowledge of data collection methods and formats, how to match data records, and how to apply basic machine learning tools such as random forest. Depending on research progress, they may also have the opportunity to explore deep learning algorithms.
